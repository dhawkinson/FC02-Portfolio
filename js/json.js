For example: \'Mark Twain\' or \'Traditional Irish proverb\'</li><li>An optional citation property which contains a string identifying the publication the quote appears in. For example, \'Famous Anonymous Jokes\'. If there is no known publication, then do not include this property on the object.</li><li>An optional year property which contains a number identifying the date of the quote. For example, 1997. If there is no known date, then do not include this property on the object.</li></ul> <p>Create a function named getRandomQuote which:</p> <ul><li>selects a random quote object from the quotes array</li><li>returns the randomly selected quote object</li></ul><p>Create a function named printQuote which follows these rules:</p><ul><li>printQuote calls the getRandomQuote function and stores the returned quote object in a variable</li><li>printQuote constructs a string using the different properties of the quote object using the following HTML template: <p class=\'quote\'> [quote here] </p> <p class=\'source\'> [source here] <span class=\'citation\'> [citation here] </span> <span class=\'year\'> [year here] </span> </p></li><li>printQuote doesn't add a <span class=\'citation\'> for a missing citation or a <span class=\'year\'> if the year property is missing</li><li>printQuote displays the final HTML string to the page. You can use the following JS snippet to accomplish that: document.getElementById('quote-box').innerHTML</li><p><strong>Make sure you add code comments to document how your functions work</strong><p><p><strong>Use JSHint (see the link in the Project Resources section) to analyze your JavaScript and identify any errors or code-style problems.</strong></p><p><strong>Make sure your program is free of syntax errors. You can monitor any errors by looking at the Developer Tools console in your browser.</strong></p><p><strong>Before you submit your project for review, make sure you can check off all of the items on the Student Project Submission Checklist. The checklist is designed to help you make sure you’ve met the grading requirements and that your project is complete and ready to be submitted!</strong></p> <p>NOTE: A good practice is to check your project for cross browser compatibility. Making sure that it looks and functions correctly in multiple (at least three) browsers is an important part of being a top-notch developer. If you want, leave a comment to the project reviewer about which browser(s) the project was checked to ensure they are seeing things as you have designed them.</p> <p>Some browser options:</p><ul><li>Google Chrome</li><li>Mozilla Firefox</li><li>Internet Explorer/Edge</li><li>Safari</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Extra Credit</strong></p><p>To get an \'exceeds\' rating, you can expand on the project in the following ways:</p><p>4 steps</p><ul><li>Add more properties to the quote object. For example, a tags property could include a list of \'tags\' like -- \'humor\', \'business\', \'politics\' -- to categorize each quote.</li><li>Randomly change the background color of the page, when the quote changes</li><li>Don't display a random quote more than once until ALL quotes from the array have been displayed.</li><li>Refresh the quote after a set amount of time. For example, every 30 seconds, make a new quote appear. (You can use the setInterval() or setTimeout() method to do this -- see the links in the Project Resources listing.)</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>NOTE: Grade Received was EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS</strong></p>"

Using progressive enhancement, your work should affect the index.html file.</li><li>Since only 10 students should be shown at a time, your programming needs to calculate the number of pages needed and add the appropriate number of links to the bottom of the page.</li><li>Hide all but the first 10 students when the page loads.</li><li>When a user clicks on \'2\' in the pagination, students 11 through 20 are shown. When a user clicks \'3\', students 21 through 30 are shown. And so on. When \'6\' is clicked 51 through 55 should be shown.</li><li>Using progressive enhancement, add the student search markup as presented in the filters-example.html file to the index.html file.</li><li>Add an event listener to the search button. When the user clicks on the button it should use the text in the search input to filter the results.</li><li>Users should be able to search by name or e-mail address. And partial matches, like just a first name, should be displayed in the results.</li><li>Search results should also be paginated. For example, if the search returns more than 10 results, those results should be paginated too.</li><li>Check your project for cross browser compatibility. Making sure that it looks and functions correctly in multiple (at least three) browsers is an important part of being a top-notch developer.
