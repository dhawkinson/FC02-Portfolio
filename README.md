# FC02-Portfolio
Free Code Camp Project 02 - Personal Portfolio

This project is similar to fivesolasdesign with the following exception.

The Website consists of a single page the contains three segments:

    * Home Segment
    * Portfolio Segment
    * Contact Segment
 
The segments may be reached by either scrolling to them or by navigating with the top navigation bar.
    
The Home Page:

    Introduces me with a brief bio and my goals in web development.
    It contains a navigation bar.
    
The Portfolio Page:

    The navigation bar is carried through to this page which introduces you to some of my 
    most notable work on the web via a gallery grid of project thumbnails. 
    Hover on the thumbnail and the name appears. Click on any of the thumbnails to see the detail
    of the project you are interested in pursuing further.
    
    The thumbnails represent websites I have built or worked on or projects I have completed.
    Each of the projects demonstrates one or more skills in design, styling or behavior responses for a
    site.
    
    The thumbnail clicked on will open in a new window and will discuss the
    unique attributes of the site or project.
    
    You will also find links to print either my resume (updated to be the most current) or a list of
    testimonials regarding me from some of my previous colleagues and clients.
    
The Contact Page:

    Carries through the navigation bar and provides you with a variety of means to contact me directly or
    research more about me.
    
    From time to time I will also post links to sites that I find are
    informative and helpful. This feature will be dynamic so seeing it
    once will not be seeing forever.
